following eagerly after; hanging upon;

Main Concept:
  A grid with arrows (or other direction indicator, henceforth DI) at each intersection.  
  A game piece will move along the grid lines following the direction of the last arrow passed through.
  A goal piece will be on the grid, either stationary or also moving
    Goal piece is moving at a slower rate than the player piece
  Clicking on the DI will rotate it 90 degrees
  Player builds a path from the piece to the goal
  Single Player Mode (POC/alpha default)
    A timer displays, when the timer runs out, all DIs will be randomized
  Two Player Mode (release default)
    Each player has their own piece and can click on any DI
      Goal is to build a path for your piece AND disrupt the path of your opponent simultaneously
